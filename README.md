# Morning Routine (last updated November, 2016)

6:30am    Philips Light for seasonal affective disorder begins lighting up (reaches peak at 7am)
7:00am    Lisa's alarm goes off, this usually wakes me up
          Get out of bed, unplug phone
          Get back in bed and begin reading New York Times morning briefing
